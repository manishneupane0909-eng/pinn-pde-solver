# pinn-pde-solver
Description- This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) in PyTorch to solve Burgers' equation, a nonlinear PDE for modeling fluid dynamics

Installation: "Clone the repo and run pip install -r requirements.txt."

Usage: "Run python main.py to train the model and generate plots."

Results:
Math/Equations: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

Contributing/Issues: Add sections for future improvements.
